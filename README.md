# TheMovieApp
An app that allows you to view Upcoming, Popular, and Now Playing movies.  You can also search for movies and see the full details of a particular movie including the theatrical, digital, and physical release dates. 
Some topics covered in this project include:
<p>
<br>*UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource (new in iOS 13)
<br>*parsing JSON using Codable
<br>*utilizing Kingfisher to load and cache images from the web
<br>*accessing an API to retrieve the movie information
<br>*support for dark mode
<br>*using SwiftUI’s preview window to “hot reload” UIKit code (see bottom of the VC files) </p>

Kingfisher installed via SPM.  All code, no storyboard.
